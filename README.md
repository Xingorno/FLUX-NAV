## Introduction
<p align="justify">
  Xray fluoroscopy continues to be the predominant modality for intra-operative image guidance, ubiquitously employed across various domains including cardiovascular, endovascular, orthopedic, and neuro-interventions, as well as in pain management and biopsies. The 2D projective nature of X-ray radiography presents significant limitations in fluoroscopy-guided interventions, particularly the loss of depth perception and prolonged radiation exposure. Integrating magnetic trackers into these workflows is promising; however, it remains challenging and under-explored in current research and practice. To address this, we employed a radiolucent magnetic field generator (FG) prototype as a foundational step towards seamless magnetic tracking (MT) integration. Overall, we demonstrated the efficacy and clinical applicability of the MT-assisted approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate a radiolucent FG into a fluoroscopy-guided workflow.
